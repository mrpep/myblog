:wave: :wave: :wave: Iâ€™m a computer science :computer: PhD candidate at Universidad de Buenos Aires :argentina:

I am working in the intersection of deep learning :brain: and audio :loud_sound:, particularly speech :speaking_head:, music :musical_score: and environmental sounds.

My PhD topic is self-supervised audio representation learning for general sound understanding.
I have worked in other audio and deep learning related topics such as:
* Emotion recognition from speech.
* Text to speech synthesis and voice cloning.
* Music source separation.
* Wakeword detection.
* NLP and textless NLP.

In my free time I like playing guitar :guitar: and travelling/hiking :earth_africa: :national_park:
